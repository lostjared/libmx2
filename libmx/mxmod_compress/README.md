# Usage Guidelines
# Compression Mode:


Command:
        
        mxmod_compress -c path/to/input_file.mxmod -o path/to/output_file.mxmod.z

Description:
Reads the specified input file, compresses its content using zlib, and writes the compressed data to the output file.
Make sure the output fileâ€™s name ends with .mxmod.z so that the program recognizes it as a valid model file for compression.
Decompression Mode:

Command TO Decompress:

    mxmod_compress -z path/to/input_file.mxmod.z -o path/to/output_file.mxmod

Description:
Reads the specified compressed input file, decompresses it, and writes the decompressed content to the output file.
Important:

You cannot specify both compression (-c) and decompression (-z) in the same command. The program will exit with an error if both are provided.
Ensure that you always provide an output file with the -o option.
